# Valheim-server
A school project.

Project Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to develop a module that facilitates the setup of a Valheim game server in a Linux environment (operating system being Debian in this case). Salt and Git must be installed beforehand.

Installation of Valheim Server: The module automates the installation of the Valheim server on the Debian operating system. This includes installing necessary packages.

Utilizing SaltStack: I use SaltStack as an automation tool. SaltStack is used to define the installation process of the Valheim server.

Why This is Beneficial:

This module makes setting up a Valheim server easier and faster in a Linux environment. It reduces manual work and the risk of errors, allowing players to spend more time playing the actual game.
